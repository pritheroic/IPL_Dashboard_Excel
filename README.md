# IPL_Dashboard_excel

In this project, I created an interactive Excel dashboard for Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into IPL matches and team performances. Here's a summary of the work done:
Data Cleaning and Enhancement:
Cleaned approximately 25% of the original dataset to improve data quality and consistency.
Added additional data fields to enrich the analysis, including:
Season
Winner Team
Runner Up
Final Match Venue
Captain
Player of the Series
Man of the Match

Data Filtering:

Implemented filters to allow users to view data according to specific requirements, enhancing the dashboard's usability and relevance.
Visualization Techniques:
Utilized multiple chart types for comprehensive data analysis:
Stacked Charts: To compare data across categories and show part-to-whole relationships.
Donut Charts: For displaying proportional data in a visually appealing circular format.
Tree Charts: To showcase hierarchical data structures and relationships.

Interactive Features:

Implemented slicers for easy season selection, allowing users to dynamically filter data based on specific IPL seasons.

Dashboard Layout:

Designed an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard layout that presents key IPL statistics and trends at a glance.
This Excel dashboard provides a powerful tool for analyzing IPL data, offering insights into team performances, 
player statistics, and tournament trends across different seasons. 
The combination of data cleaning, additional data integration, and diverse visualization techniques creates a comprehensive and interactive experience for users interested in IPL analytics.
